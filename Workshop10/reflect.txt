 In the following workshop we developed our own templates for functions and structs.
 The difficulty in the workshop was whether to have the argument / parameters as
 a pointer or reference and when we needed to dereference if needed. The debugger
 made this a little easier.

 The worskshop had us make a template to build a struct object that can be filled
 with members of any type. The struct would store a pair that our other function 
 had found. The match function would look through the two arrays and see if any 
 of the values would match. if they did it would store it in a Pair object to be 
 printed later. This allows us to interate through a student database and match
 any students who are in the BSD program or with the same function we can check
 which students students number match an array.

 It is super confusing to try and understand through reading the code, but 
 templates seem like a super powerful tool.
